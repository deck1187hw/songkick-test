## Synopsis

The WeGotTickets UK homepage is at h ttp://www.wegotickets.co.uk/. Write software that scrapes concert information from the pages on this site and outputs the data in a machine readable format of your choice (e.g. JSON, XML, CSV etc.).
To get you started, here is the first page of the ‘browse all listings’ section of the site:
http://www.wegotickets.com/searchresults/all
Each event also has its own page, which is linked to from the event titles in the above. Your script should attempt to identify:
● the artists playing
● the city
● the name of the venue
● the date
● the price
You may choose to include additional information which you think might be of interest. We are aware that it is next to impossible to get perfect data for these fields!
We are only interested in musical events, but don’t worry if your script outputs data for other kinds of events (comedy etc.) If they appear in your script’s output you can assume that they will be safely ignored.
## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.

## License

A short snippet describing the license (MIT, Apache, etc.)
